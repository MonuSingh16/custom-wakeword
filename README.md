<h1>  Spotify Wake Words Project. </h1> 

### Objective 

-  Voice interaction or commands “Hey Google”, or “Hey Siri” rely on keyword spotting to start interaction on local device. It helps people experience “Hands-free” searching and task completion

### What & Why - Challenges in above technology

- Triggers on negative wake words, unrelated speech, background noise, or silence
- High no. of instance, when device does not trigger on positive wake words 
- Need for quick response & acknowledgment 
- Ability to customise wake word 
- Wake model to be lightweight & energy efficient

### Approach 

- To design, build and deploy a lightweight Keyword spotting ML model (CNN, SVM) and exposed as a mobile-application that can process a “custom wake word”. Voice response with results by respecting local device resource constraints (low compute) and adhering to ethical challenges (Privacy respecting and non-eavesdropping)

### Aim 

- Minimize False Alarm Rate per hour of speech 
- Minimize False Reject Rate per hour of speech 
- Low latency → Measure & Reduce time to acknowledge 
- Accuracy of the custom wake word detection

### Powerpoint
- Pre-demo presentation slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FsmwdQwOyUFbaz1h2P893Sn3dWo6Cn_E/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100632006093746569721&rtpof=true&sd=true
